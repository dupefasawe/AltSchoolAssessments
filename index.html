          Assessment 1: HTML Recipe Page (Due 11/30)
        </a>

        <p>
            Reflection: Built a banana bread recipe page using inline styles and interlinking to practice HTML structure. This includes underlining, highlighting, background color and referencing images.

          Assessment 2: HTML Recipe Page (Due 12/07)
        </a>
         <br />
        <p >
            Reflection: This is an improved version of my first assessment where I applied external CSS styling to enhance the visual appeal and maintainability of the banana bread recipe page. You can toggle between pages to see the differences. I found it a bit challengiing but I know I need to keep practicing to understand the concepts better. Here are the techniques I used:
            <ul class ="related-bulletpoints">
                <li>Edited the recipe page to use an external CSS stylesheet for better style organization and easier maintenance.</li>
                <li>Experimented with combining selectors, and used both class and ID selectors effectively.</li>
                <li>Practiced using Flexbox, which was challenging at first, but the concept is becoming clearer.</li>
                <li>Added an animation effect to the ingredient boxes so they enlarge on hover, making the page feel more interactive and fun.</li>
            </ul>

          Assessment 3: JavaScript Form Prompting the User (Due 12/14)
        </a>
         <br />
        <p>
            Reflection: JavaScript has been challenging to grasp compared to HTML and CSS. In this assignment, I created a dynamic form using JavaScript that collects user input through prompt dialogs. While working on this, I learned about the concept of design and execution order, particularly why validation functions are defined before input prompts. This helped me better understand how JavaScript reads and executes code. Here are some things I did:
            <ul class ="related-bulletpoints">
              <li>Added a welcome alert message that provides users with context about the form and what to expect to enhance the user experience.</li>
              <li>Handling user cancellation gracefully to stop the program</li>
            </ul>

          Assessment 4: Student Grade Tracker (Due 12/21)
        </a>
         <br />
        <p>
            Reflection: This was super challenging as I do not think I had a lot of time to practice JavaScript before this assignment. However, I was able to create a student grade tracker that allows users to add and remove students along with their grades. Through this project, I learned more about DOM manipulation, event handling, and data validation in JavaScript. I see that I understand the concepts theoretically but need more time to practice. I will also work on a medium post to go through how I broke down the problem into separate parts. One thing that was particularly helpful was thinking about the project in terms of the data layer and UI layer. What should JavaScript handle versus what should be handled by HTML/CSS. I will spend more time to improve the UI and also practice some other concepts like highlighting scores or having one remove button.

          Final Project: Calculator (Due 02/01)
        </a>
         <br />
        <p>
            Reflection: For my final project, I developed a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allowed me to apply various concepts I've learned, such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic arithmetic operations. I focused on creating a user-friendly interface with responsive buttons and a clear display area. One of the challenges I faced was ensuring accurate calculations and handling edge cases, such as division by zero. Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of how to structure JavaScript code for functionality while maintaining a clean and appealing design with CSS.  One challenge I faced is ensuring that all the numbers stay on the screen regardless of how many digits the user inputs. I hope to continue improving the project to fix this issue.
