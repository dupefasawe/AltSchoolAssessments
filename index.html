          Assessment 1: HTML Recipe Page (Due 11/30)

        <p>
            Reflection: Built a banana bread recipe page using inline styles and interlinking to practice HTML structure. This includes underlining, highlighting, background color and referencing images.

          Assessment 2: HTML Recipe Page (Due 12/07)
        </a>
         <br />
        <p >
            Reflection: This is an improved version of my first assessment where I applied external CSS styling to enhance the visual appeal and maintainability of the banana bread recipe page. You can toggle between pages to see the differences. I found it a bit challengiing but I know I need to keep practicing to understand the concepts better. Here are the techniques I used:
            <ul>
                <li>Edited the recipe page to use an external CSS stylesheet for better style organization and easier maintenance.</li>
                <li>Experimented with combining selectors, and used both class and ID selectors effectively.</li>
                <li>Practiced using Flexbox, which was challenging at first, but the concept is becoming clearer.</li>
                <li>Added an animation effect to the ingredient boxes so they enlarge on hover, making the page feel more interactive and fun.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>  
      </li>

          Assessment 3: JavaScript Form Prompting the User (Due 12/14)
        </a>
         <br />
        <p>
            Reflection: Created a dynamic form using JavaScript that allows users to fill fields via prompt dialogs. I learnt about design + execution order concept due to my curiousity about why the validation functions come before the input prompts . I found working with prompts and alerts interesting as it provided a different way to interact with users compared to traditional form inputs. Here's a list of things that I added to my assignment that wasn't required but I found out after much research and playing around with the code:
            <ul>
              <li>Added a welcome alert message that provides users with context about the form and what to expect to enhance the user experience.</li>
              <li>Implemented real time validation for name, email, and password fields. I could have implemented the validation at the end, after the user inputs all data but I wanted to make sure each field is validated as the user inputs them for learning purposes.</li>
